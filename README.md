# Assembla Validation And Verification Process

This repository holds the codes and pipeline for Granular Control.

This pipeline helps maintaining the quality for GC.

The pipele starts from step-1 till step-9

Each step is dependent on the previous step output.

After each step we need to resolve all the errors generated by the code, only after resolving that we should go to the other step.
